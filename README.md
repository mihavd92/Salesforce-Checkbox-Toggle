Although it didn’t appear just yesterday — according to the documentation, the component was added in the Spring ’20 release, and a bit later it gained support for styling hooks.

Still, this is a real UI upgrade that allows you to conveniently change the value of a checkbox field in your LWC component in real time ⚡️

For example, if you have a custom list of Accounts (LWC) where you display the required fields from the Account object, you can integrate the Checkbox Toggle to make the user interaction much simpler and more intuitive 👌

After all, one of the key factors for your product’s success is its level of user-friendliness 🤗

Users love simple and intuitive interfaces 😉
